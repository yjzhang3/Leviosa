## Introduction
Over   the   past   three   decades,   the   number   of   reported   disasters  has  increased  fourfold.  Around  6.1  billion  people  have  been  affected  by  disasters  with  an  estimated  damage  of  almost 2.3 trillion dollars. An adequate level of mitigation measures   and   a   coordinated   post-disaster   relief   logistics   management  may  help  to  reduce  the  loss  of  both  human  lives  and economic damage.
